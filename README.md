# Fireball

The Fireball meteorite landing app is coming our way!

## Overview

This Fireball app was created by the [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) Voyage 45 Tier 1 Team 4 as proof of our team collaboration and skills. The Fireball app pulls data from the [Nasa Open Data Portal Meteorite Landings API](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh) and presents it in a nice card style, giving users the possibility to search meteorites by their name or filter them by landing year or mass. On each meteorite card users can see some interesting meteorite information or see their landing location on Google Maps.

## Feature

- Fireball React App has a [Landing Page](https://fireball-by-v45-tier1-team-04.netlify.app/) and a [Meteorite Search Page](https://fireball-by-v45-tier1-team-04.netlify.app/search)
- The Fireball app has links to NASA-related content like [NASA blogs](https://blogs.nasa.gov/) and [NASA Gallery](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html)
- Contributor GitHub links are available in the Fireball footer
- In the [Meteorite Search Page](https://fireball-by-v45-tier1-team-04.netlify.app/search) we can search and filter meteorite landings by:
  - meteorite name
  - landing year
  - meteorite mass
- The Fireball app is using API which pulls in 1000 entries
- We found a database with 45k meteorite landings but we didn't have time to implement it as of 16.09.2023.
- The [Meteorite Search Page](https://fireball-by-v45-tier1-team-04.netlify.app/search) presents individual meteorites in cards. In those cards, we can see the following meteorite info:
  - Name
  - name type
  - class
  - mass
  - fell/found status
  - landing year
  - latitude
  - longitude
  - see the meteorite landing location on Google Maps
